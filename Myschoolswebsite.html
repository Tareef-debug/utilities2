            <h1 id="big">Why is South breeze the best?</h1>South Breeze School has three campuses – two in Dhanmondi and one in Uttara.  The Uttara campus is housed in our own building with modern facilities.  The purpose-built school building has two staircases, a lift as well as a fire exit staircase, well-lit and ventilated classrooms featuring Interactive boards and white boards, as well as bulletin boards which highlight the class routines and test rosters and which also display the pupils’ handwork; a well-equipped science laboratory; a large, well-stocked library; a resource room and a canteen.  There are two areas for students to play outdoor and indoor games.  The Uttara school also has its own transport system which covers the main areas of Dhaka city.
